# Chel-Fs

Chel File System(Chel-FS), is a disaggregated software defined distributed file system (POSIX compliant), built on top of DAOS (https://github.com/daos-stack/daos). The main objective of Chel-FS is to provide scalable file system metadata management at the same time, keep the stock perforamnce/scale of DAOS for file data operations. Chel-FS is aimed for workloads that require high performance and scalable file system operations.

# Design Principles

1. A Disaggregated Distributed File System Service  
1. DAOS and Chel-Fs entity relationship  
1. Chel-Fs Metadata Service (MDS)  
1. Chel-Fs Client  
1. Snapshots  
1. Quotas
